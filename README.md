# rusted_graw

rusted_graw is a Rust event builder and data merger inspired by [graw-merger](https://github.com/ATTPC/graw-merger) used to combine and convert `.graw` files generated by the AT-TPC data acquisition to the more universal and flexible [HDF5](https://www.hdfgroup.org/) format.

## Installation

### Platform Support

rusted_graw aims to support Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Currently, rusted_graw has been tested and built successfully on Ubuntu 22.04 and MacOS 13 (Ventura).

### Downloading

To download rusted_graw clone the git repository using `git clone https://github.com/gwm17/rusted_graw.git`

### HDF5

Before building and running rusted_graw, HDF5 must be installed. Typically this will be installed using a package manager (homebrew, apt, etc), and the Rust libraries will auto detect the location of the HDF install. However, this is not always possible. Sometimes a newer version will need to be installed to a custom location. If this is the case, write the following snippet into the file `.cargo/config.toml` in the rusted_graw repository:

```[toml]
[env]
HDF5_DIR="/path/to/my/hdf5/install/"
```

Replace `/path/to/my/hdf5/install/` with the path to your HDF5 installation. Note that you will need to create the `.cargo` directory and the `config.toml` file.

### Building

To build rusted_graw simply run `cargo build --release` from the rusted_graw repository to build the optimized release binary. To build debug version use `cargo build`. Note that if build errors are present and reference HDF5, your HDF5 install may be in a non-standard location. See the above section to specify custom HDF5 install locations to the build system.

### Running

To run rusted_graw use `cargo run --release <my_config.yaml>` from the rusted_graw repository, where `my_config.yaml` is a configuration file specifying details to the application. See the below section for information on the different fields. An example configuration is given in `temp.yaml`.

## Configuration

Application configurations are specified using YAML files. A rusted_graw configuration looks like the following:

```[yaml]
graw_path: "/path/to/graw/run/directory/"
hdf_path: "/path/to/hdf/data/directory/"
pad_map_path: "/path/to/pad/map.csv"
run_number: 231
```

Note that whitespaces, colons, and quotes are important, and that the names of the fields (i.e. `graw_path`) cannot be changed. Each field is outlined below

- graw_path: Specifies the full-path to a directory which contains the AT-TPC graw structure (i.e. contains subdirectories of the run_# format)
- hdf_path: Specifies the full-path to a directory to which hdf5 (.h5) files will be written, as well as associated log files
- pad_map_path: Specifies the full path to a CSV file which contains the mapping information for AT-TPC pads and electronics
- run_number: Which run should be processed

For convience, an example configuration file (`temp.yaml`) is included with the repository.

## Output

rusted_graw will output two files: the final resulting HDF5 data file, and a log file. Log files contain valuable information about the status of the application while building the merged data. If an error occurs, typically a warning will be printed to the terminal indicating that the user should check the log file. The log file will contain the detailed status of the run and indicate the issue that occurred. Log files are also useful because they can be easily shared when errors occur. It is not advised to delete the log files.

### HDF5 Data Format

The data format used in the HDF5 data is as follows:

- All data is within the Group named "get"
- Each event corresponds to it's own Dataset within the group. The Datasets are named by event number (i.e. event 101 corresponds to Dataset 101).
- Each Dataset contains a two dimensional matrix of traces. Each row contains the data for a single trace from a pad in AT-TPC. The first five elements of the row contain the electronic address of the the pad (CoBo, AsAd, AGET, Channel, Pad in that order); the remaining 512 elements contain the trace data.
- Traces are stored in random order. That is, the Dataset matrix rows are not sorted by electronic address.

### Trace Analysis

As with its predecesor, rusted_graw does some basic analysis on the traces before writing them to disk by subtracting the fixed-pattern noise from the traces. Each AGET has four channels (11, 22, 45, 56) dedicated to measuring "fixed-pattern noise" (FPN). The traces from these four channels is averaged and baseline corrected. This averaged, corrected signal is then subtracted from every other trace present in that particular AGET, removing that noise pattern. These FPN channels are then removed from the dataset.
